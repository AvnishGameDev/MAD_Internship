# InternshipApplication ðŸŽ¯

Hub app containing 14 mini-projects accessible through buttons.

This is like a collection app with buttons that open different mini-apps. Made this to showcase multiple concepts in one place instead of having 14 separate apps. Each button opens a different small application demonstrating various Android features.

Contains 14 embedded mini-apps from temperature converters to shopping lists.
