# TicTacToe - Classic Game Implementation üéÆ

A modern implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for Android, featuring score tracking, game state management, and clean UI design.

## üì± Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Classic 3x3 Grid** - Traditional tic-tac-toe gameplay
- **Two Player Mode** - Player X vs Player O alternating turns
- **Win Detection** - Automatic detection of winning combinations
- **Draw Detection** - Game recognizes when board is full with no winner
- **Game Reset** - Start new games while maintaining score history

### User Interface
- **Visual Grid** - Interactive 3x3 game board with ImageViews
- **Turn Indicator** - Clear display of whose turn it is
- **Score Tracking** - Persistent score counter for both players
- **Reset Button** - Easy game restart functionality
- **Responsive Design** - Clean and intuitive layout

### Technical Features
- **Game Logic** - Comprehensive win/draw checking algorithms
- **State Management** - Proper game state handling and transitions
- **Click Handling** - Responsive touch interactions
- **Score Persistence** - Score tracking across multiple games
- **Game Flow Control** - Turn management and game ending logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Language**: Java
- **UI Framework**: XML layouts with ImageViews and TextViews
- **Pattern**: MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- **Game Logic**: 2D array representation of game board

### Key Components
- `MainActivity.java` - Main game activity with all game logic
- **Board Representation** - 2D integer array (0=empty, 1=X, 2=O)
- **UI Elements** - ImageViews for board, TextViews for scores and status
- **Click Listeners** - OnClickListener implementation for board interaction
- **Game Algorithms** - Win checking and draw detection methods

### Game Logic
```java
private final int[][] board = new int[3][3];
private boolean playerXTurn = true;
private int playerXScore = 0;
private int playerOScore = 0;
private boolean gameActive = true;
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK API 21 or higher
- No special permissions required

### Installation
1. Open Android Studio
2. Navigate to `TicTacToe/` directory
3. Open the project in Android Studio
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
5. Run the application on device or emulator

### No Setup Required
- No network connection needed
- No permissions required
- Works offline completely

## üìñ How to Play

### Game Rules
1. **Starting** - Player X always goes first
2. **Taking Turns** - Players alternate placing X's and O's
3. **Winning** - Get three of your symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
4. **Draw** - If the board fills up with no winner, it's a draw
5. **New Game** - Press reset to start over while keeping scores

### Game Controls
- **Tap Grid Cell** - Place your symbol (X or O) in empty cell
- **Turn Display** - See whose turn it is at the top
- **Score Tracking** - View current scores for both players
- **Reset Button** - Start new game (scores remain)
- **Automatic Detection** - Game automatically detects wins and draws

### Winning Conditions
The game checks for wins in:
- **Horizontal Lines** - Three in a row across any row
- **Vertical Lines** - Three in a column down any column  
- **Diagonal Lines** - Three in a line diagonally across the board

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
- **2D Array Management** - Using arrays to represent game state
- **Click Event Handling** - Responding to user touch interactions
- **Game Logic Implementation** - Win/lose/draw detection algorithms
- **UI State Management** - Updating interface based on game state
- **Turn-Based Logic** - Managing alternating player turns
- **Score Tracking** - Persistent data across game sessions
- **Image Resource Management** - Dynamic ImageView updates

## üîß Algorithm Details

### Win Detection
The app checks for winning combinations by:
1. **Row Check** - Scanning each horizontal line
2. **Column Check** - Scanning each vertical line  
3. **Diagonal Check** - Scanning both diagonal lines
4. **Pattern Matching** - Looking for three identical non-zero values

### Game Flow
1. Player taps empty cell ‚Üí Place symbol
2. Check for win condition ‚Üí End game or continue
3. Check for draw condition ‚Üí End game or continue
4. Switch turns ‚Üí Update UI and continue
5. Reset game ‚Üí Clear board, maintain scores

## üîß Future Enhancements

- **AI Opponent** - Single player mode against computer
- **Difficulty Levels** - Easy, medium, hard AI opponents
- **Animation Effects** - Smooth animations for moves and wins
- **Sound Effects** - Audio feedback for moves and wins
- **Custom Themes** - Different visual styles and colors
- **Game Statistics** - Track wins, losses, draws over time
- **Multiplayer Network** - Online play with friends
- **Larger Grids** - 4x4, 5x5 game variations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Cell Not Responding**: Ensure you're tapping empty cells only
- **Game Not Ending**: Win detection works automatically - no manual checking needed
- **Score Not Updating**: Scores update after each completed game
- **Reset Not Working**: Reset button clears board but maintains scores

### Debug Tips
- Only empty cells (value 0) can be clicked
- Game automatically detects wins and draws
- Use reset button to start new games
- Scores persist until app is closed
